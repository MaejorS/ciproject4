## Code Validation


### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| templates | [article_detail.html](https://github.com/MaejorS/ciproject4/blob/main/templates/article_detail.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-templates-article_detail.jpg) | checked all blog posts to make sure they were not getting errors. |
| templates | [index.html](https://github.com/MaejorS/ciproject4/blob/main/templates/index.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-templates-index.jpg) | Notes login and logout pages also cleared |
| templates | [subscribe.html](https://github.com/MaejorS/ciproject4/blob/main/templates/subscribe.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-templates-subscribe.jpg) | Notes (if applicable) |


### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| my_project4 | [style.css](https://github.com/MaejorS/ciproject4/blob/main/my_project4/static/style.css) | Link (if applicable) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-my_project4-style.jpg) |



### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static | [article.js](https://github.com/MaejorS/ciproject4/blob/main/static/js/article.js) | N/A | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-static-article.jpg) |
| static | [comments.js](https://github.com/MaejorS/ciproject4/blob/main/static/js/comments.js) | N/A | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-static-comments.jpg) |


### Python

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) can be used two different ways.

- Copy/Paste your Python code directly into the linter.
- As an API, using the "raw" URL appended to the linter URL.
    - To find the "raw" URL, navigate to your file directly on the GitHub repo.
    - On that page, GitHub provides a button on the right called "Raw" that you can click.
    - From that new page, copy the full URL, and paste it after the CI Python Linter URL (with a `/` separator).

It's recommended to validate each file using the API URL. This will give you a custom URL which you can use on your testing documentation. It makes it easier to return back to a file for validating it again in the future. Use the steps above to generate your own custom URLs for each Python file.

**IMPORTANT**: `E501 line too long` errors

You must strive to fix all Python lines that are too long (>80 characters). In rare cases where you cannot break the lines [*without breaking the functionality*], adding "`  # noqa`" (*NO Quality Assurance*) to the end of those lines will ignore linting validation. Do not use "`  # noqa`" all over your project just to clear down validation errors! This can still cause a project to fail, for failing to fix actual PEP8 validation errors.

Sometimes variables can get too long, or excessive `if/else` conditional statements. These are acceptable instances to use the "`  # noqa`" comment.

When trying to fix "line too long" errors, try to avoid using `/` to split lines. A better approach would be to use any type of opening bracket, and hit `<Enter>` just after that. Any opening bracket type will work: `(`, `[`, `{`. By using an opening bracket, Python knows where to appropriately indent the next line of code, without having to *guess* for yourself and attempt to "tab" to the correct indentation level.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

üõë IMPORTANT üõë

**IMPORTANT**: Django settings

The Django `settings.py` file comes with 4 lines that are quite long, and will throw the `E501 line too long` error. This is default behavior, but can be fixed by adding the "`  # noqa`" comment at the end of those lines.

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
]
```

**IMPORTANT**: *migration* and *pycache* files

You do not have to validate files from the `migrations/` or `pycache/` folders! Ignore these `.py` files, and validate just the files that you've created or modified.

üõë --- END --- üõë

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Browser Compatibility

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers. Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system. You DO NOT need to use all of the browsers below, just pick any 3 (minimum).

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the browsers you've tested, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time. Some of these are paid services, but some are free. If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

I've used [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/675d8e3f82872e4aac5e9913/ATTI29404379188d8338bd28cd749069d82696D598DC/project-4-code-institue) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here under bugs/errors to note](https://trello.com/invite/b/675d8e3f82872e4aac5e9913/ATTI29404379188d8338bd28cd749069d82696D598DC/project-4-code-institue).

the pattern names did not match the function created. changed the pattern name to link the correct view

I couldn‚Äôt get comments to show. turns out i forget to place the end curly bracket, which caused an error when rendering the view.
